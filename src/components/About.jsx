      <p>
        I'm a persistent problem solver, I solve problems with my{" "}
        <em>software development</em> skill. I dig deeper to understand how
        things work so that i can build better. I also explore other peoples
        projects to learn, stay curious, and keep improving. Also very much open
        to learning new things and advancing my skill to develop more
        easy-to-use interface websites.My journey shows someone whoâ€™s hands-on,
        learning fast, and steadily turning ideas into real, working products.
